# Refresh Existing Documents

Refresh reconciles existing documents with the current template contract. It is
not replacement from a template.

## Input

Selected existing documents, current evidence, and the chosen target and templates.

## Workflow

1. Read every existing selected document and every selected template completely.
2. Create a missing selected companion when the target contract calls for it.
3. Map existing sections by purpose rather than exact heading.
4. Preserve verified repository-specific facts and useful custom sections.
5. Add missing required sections in template order. Move or merge content when
   its owner changed; do not duplicate durable explanations in `AGENTS.md`.
6. Remove obsolete boilerplate, duplication, and placeholders only after useful
   content is preserved.
7. Re-read the refreshed documents together and compare them with the templates
   for structure, not wording.

## Output

Report refreshed or already-aligned documents, preserved custom content,
validation, and unresolved facts under the parent skill's output contract.

## Rules

- Never silently delete unmatched content or replace facts with placeholders.
- Report unresolved content as an open fact.
